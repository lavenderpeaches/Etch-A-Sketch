# Etch-A-Sketch
The fourth project of The Odin Project.

I have used the DOM methods to-
(i) Create a 16 x 16 grid initially. 
(ii) Take user input using prompt function.
(iii) Based on that input creating a new grid in using same amount of pixels.
(iv) Using rgb values to randomise the background colors.
